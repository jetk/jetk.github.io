<p>I waste a lot of time trying to be better at being human. I say â€˜wasteâ€™ largely because I tend to dabble in something potentially beneficial, but get distracted/forget long before I can reap said benefits. I also consume waaay too much productivity/wellness/spirituality content and occasionally come across a few gems.</p>

<p>This list is here because it forces me to have everything mapped out in one place, which in turn forces me to remember that Iâ€™m supposed to be doing it. It also forces me to review habit. Also, itâ€™s public and dated so anyone reading it that knows me can bollock me for not having reviewed it in the last month.</p>
