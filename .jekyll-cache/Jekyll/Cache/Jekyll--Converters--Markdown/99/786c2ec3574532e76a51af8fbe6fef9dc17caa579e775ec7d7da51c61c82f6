I"M<p>“I like big bats and I cannot l-“ no.
“Does the Batman of bats refer to himself as Manbat?” no.
Ok I can’t come up with something witty. I just like watching bats, ok?</p>

<p>There are some obvious reasons to watch bats:</p>
<ol>
  <li>They look adorable</li>
  <li>Cute flapping noises if one gets close</li>
  <li>Gets you outside (if you have indoor bats call me)</li>
  <li>Better than watching a screen</li>
</ol>

<p>But I watch bats for another reason:</p>
<ol>
  <li>They’re hard to watch.</li>
</ol>

<p>Because they’re hard to watch, something cool happens when I watch them, which I find valuable. What happens to me is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>My eyes start seeing in a different mode</li>
  <li>My brain wipes itself of whatever banalities were plagueing me</li>
  <li>My entire sense of being suspends for a minute and I become simple awareness</li>
  <li>Bats</li>
  <li>I am nothing but bats flying across a visual field</li>
  <li>This somehow makes me feel better about everything for a while after having stopped</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hard-thing-1---bat-activity-times">Hard thing #1 - Bat activity times</h3>
<p>Bats come out at dusk, which is cool for them, but it makes the critters pretty hard to spot.</p>

<p>I am not a zoologist and I do not play one on the internet, but I found it pretty cool to note that most creatures are diurnal or nocturnal due to predator/prey relationships. Bats are interesting because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They have predators, mainly birds of prey. These predators sleep at night, making that a safe time to be a bat in the air.</li>
  <li>They prey on insects, but so do other animals. Most of these other animals also sleep at night, so coming out at night reduces the competition</li>
</ul>

<p>Supposedly, flying takes up a lot of energy for bats. As the only flying mammel, they’re way less biomechanically efficient than birds, so they have very short activity times.</p>

<p>Overall, this means you only have a 30-60 minute activity window at dusk for top-quality bat watching, after which it becomes too dark and bats go back to roost anyway. Apparently they also hunt at dawn but I’m lazy so dusk it is.</p>

<h3 id="hard-thing-2---bat-hunting-grounds">Hard thing #2 - Bat hunting grounds</h3>
<p>Here I’m sure there are plenty of people who know better than me, but all the bats I found seem to enjoy hunting over ponds and other small bodies of water. If I get there early enough, I can see tonnes of bugs hovering above the surface, which I expect is what lures bats there.</p>

<p>This means I tend to hang out at places like this to look for bats. You’ll notice something interesting: my visual field in places like this is two bands of light (the sky and its reflection in water) bisected by a band of dark.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../img/gingerwine.jpg" /></p>

<p>You may know that bats are dark-furred creatures, making them very hard to spot in the dark, but very easy to spot silhoutted against the light. But given the setup we have above, this means that to spot bats you effectively need to unfocus and keep your attention spread between two parts of your visual field. More on that later</p>

<h3 id="hard-thing-3---bat-movement">Hard thing #3 - Bat movement</h3>
<p>Have you ever seen a bat fly? They don’t soar, but careen around in an exciting aeroballetic tumble. For all their inefficiencies, they are crazy manoeverable and famously echolocate their pray with sonar.</p>

<p>This means that instead of flying in more-or-less straight lines with gentle arcing turns, bats snap and whip around like tiny dogfighters. I can even picture them in the airbase locker room, tiny goggles on their heads, zipping into tiny flight-suits and trash-talking each other about how many bogeys (buggies?) they’re gonna take down tonight.</p>

<p>Couple this erratic movement with the fact that you can’t spot bats when they’re directly in front of you, only above and below, and you’ve got one hell of a challenge for your visual faculties</p>

<h3 id="putting-it-together">Putting it together</h3>

<p>So there are a tonne of interesting things to say about human vision that I wish I could say here, but the most relevant ones are that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If you look at a non-moving world, your attention is <a href="https://www.convergent.com/resources/the-human-brain-hardwired-for-motion/">going to jump to the moving things</a></li>
  <li>If you then focus on the moving thing, <a href="http://www.theinvisiblegorilla.com/gorilla_experiment.html">you tend to miss other new things</a></li>
</ol>

<p>These two things pose hours and hours of challenges in UX design, remember the days before you used an ad-blocker, and after advertisers discovered animated gifs? It made reading and even occasionally watching anything on the web a nightmare for your visual apparatus. There are still plenty of examples of</p>

<p>If you’re putting effort into seeing bats, it becomes really exciting.</p>
<ul>
  <li>focus on one and you lose the others</li>
  <li>try to track multiple moving targets at once</li>
  <li>having to maintain soft unfocus</li>
  <li>relaxing</li>
  <li>too much to also process thoughts at the same time</li>
  <li>before you know it you’ll have blissed out in a weird meditative trance for longer than you expected</li>
  <li>these micropops of bats appearing hit all the dopamine triggers that social notifications</li>
</ul>

<p>Interesting topics:</p>

  <li>visual field</li>
  <li>dopamine</li>
  <li>flow</li>
  <li>mindlessness</li>
  <li>awareness vs ‘I’</li>
