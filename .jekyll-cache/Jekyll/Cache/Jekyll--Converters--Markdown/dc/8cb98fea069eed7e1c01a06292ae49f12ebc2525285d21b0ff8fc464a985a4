I"ê<p>TL-DR: Watching bats in a certain way can induce a trance-like flowstate leaving me refreshed and better at dealing with life</p>

<p>‚ÄúI like big bats and I cannot l-‚Äú no.
‚ÄúDoes the Batman of bats refer to himself as Manbat?‚Äù no.
Ok I can‚Äôt come up with something witty. I just like watching bats, ok?</p>

<p>There are some obvious reasons to watch bats:</p>
<ol>
  <li>They look adorable</li>
  <li>Cute flapping noises if one gets close</li>
  <li>Gets you outside (if you have indoor bats call me)</li>
  <li>Better than watching a screen</li>
</ol>

<p>But I watch bats for another reason:</p>
<ol>
  <li>They‚Äôre hard to watch.</li>
</ol>

<p>Because they‚Äôre hard to watch, something cool happens when I watch them, which I find valuable. What happens to me is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>My eyes start seeing in a different way</li>
  <li>My brain wipes itself of whatever banalities plague me</li>
  <li>My entire sense of being suspends for a minute and I become simple awareness</li>
  <li>Bats</li>
  <li>I am nothing but bats flying across a visual field</li>
  <li>This somehow makes me feel better about everything for a while after having stopped</li>
</ul>

<p>So let‚Äôs step through the hard things about watching bats, what this forces me to do when I watch them, and how that results in the cool stuff above.</p>

<h3 id="hard-thing-1---bat-activity-times">Hard thing #1 - Bat activity times</h3>
<p>Bats come out at dusk, which is cool for them, but it makes the critters pretty hard to spot.</p>

<p>I am not a zoologist and I do not play one on the internet, but I found it pretty cool to note that most creatures are diurnal or nocturnal due to predator/prey relationships. Bats are interesting because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They have predators, mainly birds of prey. These predators sleep at night, making that a safe time to be a bat in the air.</li>
  <li>They prey on insects, but so do other animals. Most of these other animals also sleep at night, so coming out at night reduces the competition</li>
</ul>

<p>Supposedly, flying takes up a lot of energy for bats. As the only flying mammel, they‚Äôre way less biomechanically efficient than birds, so they have very short activity times.</p>

<p>Overall, this means you only have a 30-60 minute activity window at dusk for top-quality bat watching, after which it becomes too dark and bats go back to roost anyway. Apparently they also hunt at dawn but I‚Äôm lazy so dusk it is.</p>

<h3 id="hard-thing-2---bat-hunting-grounds">Hard thing #2 - Bat hunting grounds</h3>
<p>Here I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of people who know better than me, but all the bats I found seem to enjoy hunting over ponds and other small bodies of water. If I get there early enough, I can see tonnes of bugs hovering above the surface, which I expect is what lures bats there.</p>

<p>This means I tend to hang out at places like this to look for bats. You‚Äôll notice something interesting: my visual field in places like this is two bands of light (the sky and its reflection in water) bisected by a band of dark.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../img/bats.jpg" /></p>

<p>You may know that bats are dark-furred creatures, making them very hard to spot in the dark, but very easy to spot silhoutted against the light. But given the setup we have above, this means that to spot bats you effectively need to unfocus and keep your attention spread between two parts of your visual field. More on that later</p>

<h3 id="hard-thing-3---bat-movement">Hard thing #3 - Bat movement</h3>
<p>Have you ever seen a bat fly? They don‚Äôt soar, but careen around in an exciting aeroballetic tumble. For all their inefficiencies, they are crazy manoeverable and famously echolocate their pray with sonar.</p>

<p>This means that instead of flying in more-or-less straight lines with gentle arcing turns, bats snap and whip around like tiny dogfighters. I can even picture them in the airbase locker room, tiny goggles on their heads, zipping into tiny flight-suits and trash-talking each other about how many bogeys (buggies?) they‚Äôre gonna take down tonight.</p>

<p>Couple this erratic movement with the fact that you can‚Äôt spot bats when they‚Äôre directly in front of you, only above and below, and you‚Äôve got one hell of a challenge for your visual faculties</p>

<h3 id="putting-it-together">Putting it together</h3>

<p>So there are a tonne of interesting things to say about human vision that I wish I could say here, but the most relevant ones are that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If you look at a non-moving world, your attention is <a href="https://www.convergent.com/resources/the-human-brain-hardwired-for-motion/">going to jump to the moving things</a></li>
  <li>If you then focus on the moving thing, <a href="http://www.theinvisiblegorilla.com/gorilla_experiment.html">you tend to miss other new things</a></li>
  <li>The farther away things are from the moving thing you‚Äôre tracking, the more likely you are to miss them</li>
</ol>

<p>These things pose hours and hours of challenges in UX design; remember the days before you used an ad-blocker, but after advertisers discovered animated gifs? It made reading and even occasionally watching anything on the web a nightmare for your visual apparatus. There are still plenty of examples of modern apps that completely kill usability through gratuitous animation.</p>

<!-- upgrades to this: visual theory in UX, clustering, examples of bad UX -->

<p>That diversion aside, what does this mean for bat-watching? Well, we don‚Äôt want to miss any bats! So first off, we can‚Äôt look at one just area, because bats are only visible both below and above the band of dark. Secondly, if we start tracking one bat, say in the top zone, we might miss bats in the bottom zone! So we need to intentionally try to keep two zones in focus at the same time, and we also need to be aware of bats flitting across them without our eyes jumping to follow them.</p>

<p>Doing that, at least for me, means adopting a 1000-yard stare and putting all of your attention into maintaining it. This is hard work, and after a few minutes of doing this, something quite magical happens. My monkey-mind, which is always screaming about stuff not to forget (both imporatant tasks and some remembered slight that happened to me ages ago), gets tamped down. Slowly, as I watch the bats, awareness suffuses all of my experience until there is nothing left. Nothing is there, commenting on me commenting that nothing is there, only bats. And for a few moments or an eterinity, I am not. It is pure experience, and it is wonderful. And whenever I come out of this state, I feel fresh, happy and calm. I can face the rest of the week with a greater degree of peace and equanimity. My knee-jerk reactions don‚Äôt come as quickly, and sometimes I can even step in and deflect them. Overall, it lightens me, and that helps me live my life immensely.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs happened here? We could gab about this for ages, and soon I‚Äôll link to some articles that explain flow states, meditation and ego dissolution much better than I can. For now, I‚Äôll just hypothesise that I‚Äôm not the only person to ever think that doing some activity like this, i.e. meaningfully capturing your attention and turning yourself off for a bit, has benenfits.</p>
