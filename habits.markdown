*last reviewed 2020-05-27*

I waste a lot of time trying to be better at being human. I say 'waste' largely because I tend to dabble in something potentially beneficial, but get distracted/forget long before I can reap said benefits. I also consume waaay too much productivity / wellness / spirituality content and occasionally come across a few gems.

This list is here because it forces me to have everything mapped out in one place, which in turn forces me to remember that I'm supposed to be doing it. Also, it's public and dated so anyone reading it can bollock me for not having reviewed it in the last month.


#### Vocational
- Trawl lists of 'must-read' product management books and get the gist on Blinkist
- Step back and ask if you need it
- Learn CSS and Vue, build pretty working prototypes and let your devs tell you how you implemented it like a child

#### Thinking Well
- As yourself what the most important question is
- Pick out the part that makes you uncomfortable and find a way to get reps in

#### Being Well
- In mental judo with your worst thoughts, wrestling is bad, foot-sweeping is good
- Don't tire yourself out arguing in your head. Relax and save energy
- Do sitting medition every day

#### Bodying Well
- Immediately upon waking, stand up and do Zhan Zhuang
- Dive back into work for 30 minutes after lunch before your brain slows down, only then take a coffee break

#### Other People
- Don't take it personally
- Rule 1 of dealing with problems: don't become an additional casualty
- Write a user's manual to yourself and review it
