                <p>Looks like you found me. Ok, I'm not that great at web design, so I'm going to summarise myself as a venn diagram:</p>

                Below, I've broken my life into a bunch of '-er' words, so have a look and reach out if you see anything cool!
                <div id="accordion">
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                                From 2010-2015 I worked in finance. The bulk of that time I proudly spent at a European firm called Silverpeak, advising tech companies. Silverpeak is a boutique investment bank focused on helping startups raise the capital they needed to fund their growth, or to find a large corporate acquirer if the founders needed a new mansion (just kidding; being acquired by a tech corporate will supercharge your company and scale to a global level).

                        </li>

                            <div id="programmer" class="accordion">
                                Since 2015, I've been on an MSc for Computer Science at University College, London (UCL). Why? Because I always wanted to, and after spending five years advising people that make cool things (see above) I wanted a chance to make cool things myself. I don't claim to be a good programmer, but I do love it and it does come naturally to me.
                            </div>

                                I like taking things apart and putting them together again. I'm currently lucky enough to have access to the UCL's Institute of Making, which is awesome.

                                I enjoy picking things up and putting them down. I also have learned a suprising amount about physiology and basic biological process through years of poring through (bro)science.

                                But not as you would think! I, like any other nerd, used to play lots of these newfangled 'video' games. But, these days I find myself enjoying Pen'n'Paper RPGs (WFRP2E,40k,M&amp;M,GURPS,Cthulhu) and Board Games (Dead of Winter, Eldritch Horror, 7 Wonders, Catan, Dominion) the most. I also dabble in Frostgrave and have a lot of MTG cards.

                                This is where I start getting called hipster, but I build stuff out of cargo pallets that I find. I mean, wouldn't you? Free wood! Who turns that down???

                                Mainly metal these days, but who doesn't also love a bit of punk and rock'n'roll?

                                Ok, I agree, abusing the word 'lover' means I can more or less extend this ridiculous naming system I've constrained myself to with impunity. But, I thought it's worth mentioning because I love eating, making and looking at food of all kinds (that includes cofee and booze). My sister and I have a foodstagram, check out kloogfood.
