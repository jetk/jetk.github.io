I remember now, the feel of knurled steel in my hands. I remember crushing weight. Sweat, ragged breath and the smell of chalk dust. Repetition. Repetition. My body screaming in exertion.

But I also remember pushing through what was to what could be. I remember seeing so clearly where I was going. Of staring through work and time to what would be built.

I remember impatience. I remember overreaching. Failure. Crumbling. Dejection.

I remember honesty. I remember finally accepting what was broken and only then being able to rebuild. I remember throwing out the plaster I was using for cracks, and laying new foundations.

I remember patience. I remember accumulation. I remember small changes rolling into big ones. I remember my technique saving me when my strength failed.

I remember that I used to remember this, even when I could not feel that knurled steel in my hands. That I carried these memories with me through my day, into everything that I did.

It said nothing and reminded me of everything.
